    The TC39 committee is comprised of between 50 and about <br>
    100 different people from a broad section of web-invested <br>
    companies, such as browser makers (Mozilla, Google, Apple) <br>
    and device makers (Samsung, etc). All members of the committee <br>
    are volunteers, though many of them are employees of <br>
    these companies and so may receive compensation in part for <br>
    their duties on the committee. <br><br>
    TC39 meets generally about every other month, usually for <br>
    about three days, to review work done by members since the <br>
    last meeting, discuss issues, and vote on proposals. Meeting <br>
    locations rotate among member companies willing to host.<br>
    <strong>All TC39 proposals progress through a five-stage process—</strong><br>
    of course, since we’re programmers, it’s 0-based!—Stage 0<br>
    through Stage 4. You can read more about the Stage process<br>
    here: https://tc39.es/process-document/<br><br>
    Stage 0 means roughly, someone on TC39 thinks it’s a worthy<br>
    idea and plans to <strong>champion</strong> and work on it. That means lots<br>
    of ideas that non-TC39 members “propose,” through informal<br>
    means such as social media or blog posts, are really “pre-stage<br>
    <strong>0.” You have to get a TC39 member to champion a proposal for</strong><br>
    it to be considered “Stage 0” officially.<br><br>
    Once a proposal reaches “Stage 4” status, it is eligible to be<br>
    included in the next yearly revision of the language. It can<br>
    take anywhere from several months to a few years for a<br>
    proposal to work its way through these stages.<br>
    All proposals are managed in the open, on TC39’s Github<br>
